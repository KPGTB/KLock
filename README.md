**KLock** is an advanced & modern minecraft plugin that adds **lock and lock picking mechanic**. With this plugin you can secure any **open-able block** with lock, and later you can only open it or break with key. Players can also craft a lock pick and open blocks without a key. It is done by simple opening **minigame** with **custom UI**. Server's staff can obtain **the universal key** (by command) to open every lock.
